# Touch Buddy

Touch Buddy is  a task reporting, tracking scheduling system for establishments that have multiple meeting rooms, such as as executive briefing centres that utilise Cisco's codec with the Tough-10 control panel. 

A common problem in such centres is that there are usually a finite number of technical-support resources allocated to a site. During events it is sometimes necessary for meeting hosts request assistance from these resources, without disrupting the meeting. It is also important to track the utilisation of support resources and the types of issues reported.


## Touch Buddy Fundamentals as a test

Touch buddy requires that all meeting rooms be equipped with Cisco codec that is equipped with the Cisco Telepresence Touch-10 controllable panel. The touch buddy Python code then makes use of the Cisco codec's operating system's "Room Control" restful API
